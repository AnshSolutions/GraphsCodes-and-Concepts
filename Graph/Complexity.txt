Algorithm

Time Complexity

Explanation

DFS

O(V + E)

Visits every node once and every edge once

BFS

O(V + E)

Every node and edge is processed once in the queue

****************************************DSU****************************************
Time Complexity for Cycle Detection using DSU: O(E * α(V)), where:
E = number of edges
V = number of vertices
α(V) ≈ O(1) for all practical purposes
